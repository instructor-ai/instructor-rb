## Usage

To check out all the tips and tricks to prompt and extract data, check out the [documentation](https://instructor-ai.github.io/instructor-rb/tips/prompting/).

```Ruby
require 'instructor-rb'

OpenAI.configure do |config|
    config.access_token = ENV.fetch("OPENAI_ACCESS_TOKEN")
    config.organization_id = ENV.fetch("OPENAI_ORGANIZATION_ID") # Optional.
end

class UserDetail
  include EasyTalk::Model
  
  define_schema do
    property :name, String
    property :age, Integer
  end
end
  
client = Instructor.patch(OpenAI::Client).new

user = client.chat(
parameters: {
    model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Extract Jason is 25 years old' }]
},
response_model: UserDetail
)

user.name
# => "Jason"
user.age
# => 25
```

## Why use Instructor?

The question of using Instructor is fundamentally a question of why to use zod.

1. **Powered by OpenAI** — Instructor is powered by OpenAI's function calling API. This means you can use the same API for both prompting and extraction.

2. **Ruby Schema Validation** — Instructor uses Ruby schema validation with type hinting. This means you can validate your data before using it.
